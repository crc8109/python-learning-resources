* __(course - Free)__ _Python for Data Science_ (UCSD) _EdX.org_ class:
  - Link: https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-0
  - Notes: Archived version. Designed to be 8-10 hours of effort/work per week but you can go at your own pace.
  
* __(article)__ __Towards Data Science__: _Python Basics for Data Science_:
  - Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/python-basics-for-data-science-6a6c987f2755
  - Notes: It's a pretty good primer on the basics of python (data types, functions, methods, etc). It serves well as a reference sheet in the future.

* __(course - Not Free -- usually $9.99)__ _Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp_:
  - Link: https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/ 
  - Notes: Jose Portilla from Pieran Data (his startup I think) has a bunch of great courses on Udemy. They are all usually "on sale" at $9.99 and even though it's not free it's a pretty good deal because you go from very beginner python  to some powerful machine learning algorithms (if you understand the basics of programming in any other language you'll be ok). 

* __(course - Free -- 4 hours total)__ _Intro to Python by __DataCamp___: 
  - https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science
  - This is a very short intro course (4 hours total) but it'll get you started on the right track.

* __(online platform)__ https://codechalleng.es 
  - These are a bunch of bite-sized exercises to _"hone your python skills in the comfort of your own browser"_
  - Not focused in data science but I find it useful to not forget simple details.
  
  * __(tutorials)__ 100+ FREE tutorials from _Real Python_:
  - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XpBj4_-9HZzYh51WsWeBH1pzHPJIX83-SdUWQgiE3No/edit?usp=sharing
  - _Real Python_'s website has been adding more and more free tutorials. They cover everything from an introduction to Python, to web development, to web scraping, and even data science. These are text tutorials, not video.
  
* __(tutorials)__ Data Science tutorials at _Real Python_:
  - https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/
  - _Real Python_'s website has been adding more and more tutorials regarding data science. They are focused on specific tasks (reading/writing CSV files, cleaning data, text classification, etc) and they are very thorough. These are text tutorials, not video.

* __(video tutorials)__ Corey Schafer's youtube channel:
  - beginner python series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7 
  - Corey Schafer's channel is full of tutorials on all things related to software development (git, command line, python, javascript, etc). 

* __(video tutorials)__ PyCon and SciPy:
  - These tutorials last about 3 hours (there's a lot of downtime between exercises) and their code is on GitHub. You can follow along at your own pace and they're a pretty good start in general. Especially if you already know some programming. 
    - `Pandas` for Data Analysis (SciPy 2017) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGzU688xCUs 
    - Intro to `python` and Programming (SciPy 2018) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmxy2NU9LOI 
    - `Pandas` for Data Science (PyCon 2018) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hsKLYfyQZc 

* __(blog posts)__ Anna-Lena Popkes -
  - She did a _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge to learn `python` (for machine learning) and documented her journey in a series of blog posts where she created a "magical world" to explain what a Class is, inheritance, functions, etc. It's very easy and entertaining to follow.
    - Day 1: http://alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/coding-challenge-day-1/ 
    - GitHub: https://github.com/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics 
    - She had an interview on _[Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm)_ (podcast - :star::star::star::star::star: 100% recommend) where she explains the whole thing  https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/186/100-days-of-python-in-a-magical-universe 

* __(examples)__ Lots of python code snippets to study, recreate, or save you when you're stuck
  - https://www.pythonprogramming.in/ 

* __(online courses - Free)__ Multiple tracks to learn many different Data Science skills -
  - https://cognitiveclass.ai/
